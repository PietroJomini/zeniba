## z-library seizure

As you probably know, recently z-library has been seized by the United States Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation: you can see the official blog post [here](http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/blog/36) (onion link).

So, now the library is only accessible through TOR. So, [login](auth.md#authentication) is mandatory and you need to install the TOR browser or [enable a proxy](config.md#tor-proxy) in any other way.
